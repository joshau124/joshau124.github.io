## All the way back

College has been my first experience with hard to read code. In high school, I took a basic programming class that taught basic Python and JavaScript, fooling me into thinking Computer Science would be a breeze. The past semesters led me to believe the further I dug down, the harder it would get. So, imagine my surprise when I walk into my Software Engineering class to find out I'll be using an augmented version of JavaScript all the way back from high school. 

## All the way here

Jumping back to the present, I find myself falling back on old knowledge as a stepping stone to learn new skills. I had never heard of TypeScript before, but basically it is a superset of JavaScript that allows for enhanced maintainability and scaleability. Furthermore, TypeScript has a static typing system, rather than a dynamic typing system, which allows for errors to be found in the compiler as you're typing, instead of after attempting to run the code for the first time. Additionally, TypeScript is, in my opinion, easier to read. The inclusion of type annotations allows for a higher level of self documentation, leading to less guesses and errors while coding. I think TypeScript is a "good" coding language from a Software Engineering perspective because of the way it improves JavaScript, allowing for larger-scale projects to be completed with this superset of JavaScript.

## All about WOD

All about what? All about Workout of the Day (WOD). These were introduced to me in my Software Engineering class, and in laymans terms its a timed coding assignment. The philosophy behind WODs are similar to that of sports training. In order to improve a skill, you repeat it to get better, like how some online artists create one piece everyday for 365 and show massive improvements. So far, I have completed 4 WODs and I feel like this is an efficient way to learn. While some do not like being timed, this aspect forces me to focus and actively practice, rather than sit and doomscroll for an hour on my phone before getting back to my coding projects. Even though I knew a bit about JavaScript, the daily WODs have helped me learn TypeScript much faster than if I learned in a lecture style environment.
