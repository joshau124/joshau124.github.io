## Pulling yourself up by your Bootstrap (5)

While normally it's impossible to pull yourself up by your boot straps in real life, you can pull up your code with Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a front-end framework that helps stylize your code. Even though it is possible to achieve the same effects with raw HTML and CSS, it is much much easier to use Bootstrap for this. However, Bootstrap isn’t going to magically make your front end look prettier, you need to put in the work. For my Software Engineering class, our professor had us use Bootstrap for a few assignments. I struggled a lot with it, since it was something super new to me, and I didn’t end up doing that well. However, I can still understand the utility and usefulness of it. 

## Potential Code

Given the same projects again, I would continue to use Bootstrap, as even though I’m not the best with it, it is much easier to use Bootstrap that I don’t fully understand, than using raw HTML and CSS code. This is because of the potential of Bootstrap. Even though I’m not the best at Bootstrap, if I were to put in the time and effort to learn it, I know that my code would be much cleaner and nicer than if I didn’t have it. The potential of Bootstrap justifies learning, which is almost as difficult as a new language instead of using what is familiar.
