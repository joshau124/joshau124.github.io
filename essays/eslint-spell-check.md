## Across Languages

Each language in coding is fairly different to type out. For example, there are tons of classes to use in Java, even when you just want to print something. On the other hand, classes don't even exist in the C language. One of the few things they both have in common is that coding standards can be applied to each. While they are applied differently to each language, there are some constants that are kept throughout the different languages, such as naming conventions as well as the spacing between groups of code.

## Spell check for English and ES Lint for JavaScript

Just like how grammar affects English, coders have developed a "static code analysis tool" that looks at Javascript code and enforces good coding standards. These standards are customizable, so not every piece of JavaScript is going to have the same ES Lint rules. However, in general, this program helps to refine the quality of code through highlighting bad coding habits as well as potential problems, such as unused variables. I have been using ES Lint for my college Software Engineering class and I actually enjoy it. Something that has always bothered me is code that is ugly to look at. In previous programming classes, I've had to cooperatively code something with others and it was internally difficult for me to do. Most people had a good coding style, but some people just made code that worked, the code was inconsistent and so condensed at certain sections. Although, using ES Lint made me realize I need to get better at my own coding standard. I've had some trouble with the finer points of ES Lint, as I would focus much more on code that works, while maintiaining a very basic coding standard that held much less priority in my head. I'm sure that as I utilize ES Lint in more coding assignments that I will gradually get better at coding within the set standards of my Software Engineering class. So, I appreciate ES Lint for enforcing a strict coding standard that ensures consistency and a comfortable, neat, looking code.
