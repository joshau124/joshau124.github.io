Third, create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

## From the Past

While in highschool, I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up, so I simply tried a bit of everything. I took anatomy classes and music classes but nothing stuck to me except my programming 1 class that I took in my senior year. This class selection started me down the path of software engineering and computer science that I find myself on today. In addition to that, my father works as a software designer, so he helped me learn the basics of simpler languages like Python when I was a high schooler.

## In the Present

My passion for computer science stems from my interest in problem solving. I think its so interesting how there are so many different ways to solve each problem presented to us in life, and how the choices we make affect decisions we make down the line. So, the fact that we can utilize code to solve one single problem in many different ways appeals to me. During my time as a student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I've utilized code to solve problems in many different ways, attempting to optimize my code to be more efficient. Like personal problems, the way we solve smaller sub-problems affects the code we will write to solve larger problems in the same project later on during production. This makes scalability, management, and documentation skills I would like to focus on and maintain in my future as a software engineer.

## To the Future

Even though I've learned much in college about programming, I know there is always more to be gained. As much as I hope to develop skills within the IT field, even more so, I wish to gain real world experience through internships and part time jobs. This would give me the chance to apply the skills I've maintained in the real world and learn how to make use of them. Of these skills, I hope to improve my teamwork the most. In the past, I've only collaborated with others in coding assignments in my Data Structures and Algorithms class, and there wasn't much teamwork, more so letting one person do everything and nodding along with what happened. Due to this experience, I think it is important for me to improve my teamwork skills when it comes to coding projects with others.
