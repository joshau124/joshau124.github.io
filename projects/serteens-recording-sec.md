*"The George B. Carter Serteens Club of Hawaii provides social interaction and leadership training for gifted and talented students who wish to serve the community."*

The George B. Carter Serteens Club of Hawaii is a club funded by the non-profit organization, Sertoma. This club is aimed at gifted students betweeen 7th and 12th grade, featuring a strict requirement to obtain membership. This includes a nationally recognized test score within the top 2 percentile (ex. SAT, ACT), 130+ IQ, or qualifications for a gifted and talented program by DOE requirements. Serteens focused on leadership and community service. During my time as a member, I attended many community service projects and even helped plan for some camp activities, such as beach clean ups, volunteer work at an arboretum, and assisting during the American Heart Association Heart Walks.

Even though this is not connected to computer science and coding, I learned excelent file organizing and communication skills. After one year of attending as a member, I ran for the position of Recording Secretary, the officer that takes minutes during meetings. As the Recording Secretary, I organized minutes(official business documentation of club meetings) that would be sent to the club's national sponsoring organization, banking institutions, and the IRS. This position allowed me to grow my filing and organization skills, along with my documentation, all of which are essential in large scale programs. In addition to my officer responsibilities, I was also a member of the camp committee, the section of the club that plans and budgets for the club's camps.
